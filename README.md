# Professional Portfolio Project

This is my submission for the Module 2 Advanced CSS Challenge: Professional Portfolio project for the Rutgets Coding Bootcamp.

This application uses flexbox, pseudo-classes, media queries, and other advanced CSS techniques to provide a visually appealing and functional webpage with access to some of my projects, a short "about me," some of my contact information, and a dummy section for a resume (I do not yet have one).
